CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:14 (add_executable):
  Cannot generate a safe runtime search path for target MTCNN because files
  in some directories may conflict with libraries in implicit directories:

    runtime library [libcudnn.so.5] in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu may be hidden by files in:
      /usr/local/cuda/lib64

  Some of these libraries may not be found correctly.
